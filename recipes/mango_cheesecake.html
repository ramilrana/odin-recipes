    <h1>Coconut-Lime Cheesecake with Mango Coulis</h1>
    <img src="../resources/mangoCheesecake.webp" alt="" />
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      This tropical-inspired mango Key lime cheesecake features a ginger-coconut
      crust and two divine layers topped off with a fresh mango coulis. I like
      to make coconut cream by adding coconut extract to whipped cream for
      topping the cheesecake. Top with a whipped cream dollop and toasted
      coconut sprinkle for even more flavor.

      Here is the 11 steps on how to make a Coconut-Lime Cheesecake with Mango
      Coulis
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a
        9-inch springform pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine coconut, gingersnap cookies, and melted butter in a bowl; mix
        until evenly moistened. Press cookie mixture into the bottom and
        slightly up the sides of the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake crust in the preheated oven until browned and set, about 10
        minutes. Set aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>Reduce oven heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Beat softened cream cheese in a mixing bowl until smooth. With the
        beater set to medium-low, slowly pour condensed milk into the bowl,
        mixing only until just blended and stopping to scrape the sides of the
        bowl as necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition; scrape the
        sides of the bowl as necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour about 1/2 of the cream cheese batter into a separate bowl. Stir
        lime zest and lime juice into portion in the new bowl; pour batter over
        crust in the springform pan, smoothing into an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir coconut extract through remaining cream cheese batter; pour over
        lime-flavored batter in the springform pan, smoothing into an even
        layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until top of cheesecake springs back when
        gently pressed, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn oven heat off, but leave cheesecake inside with the oven door
        slightly ajar until the oven cools completely. Refrigerate until
        thoroughly chilled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare mango coulis by puréeing mango with sugar in a blender until
        smooth. If too thick, add 1 teaspoon water at a time, using just enough
        to make it pourable. Drizzle over cheesecake when plated.

    </ol>
